# 🐙 GitGetter
An open-source install wizard which can fetch releases automatically.

### 🎉 Features
- Easy to use GUI for creating your setup wizard
- Support for Windows and MacOS with more platforms in the future
- Only make one wizard: GitGetter will always fetch the latest release for the platform depending on your set rules, and even give the user an option of which version to install.
- Update support: Launching the bundled "updator" application installed with the app allows it to be updated easily.
- Fully customizable: Change anything from rules to themes and even pre and post install code with the Rust lang.
- Save your wizard settings as a .toml file to share with others or repurpose in the future.
- Designed for ease of end users: A familiar wizard UI without the need to know anything about Git or Github.
- Open sourced under the [Apache License](./LICENSE)

> **Important**
